Refine and fix the existing racing game implementation.

KEEP all existing UI, dashboard layout, colors, fonts, and retro aesthetic.
DO NOT remove or redesign the right-side SYSTEMS dashboard.

Critical fixes and additions:

========================
1. LANDING SCREEN (FIRST LOAD)
========================
- On initial load, show a fullscreen landing screen.
- Black/dark background.
- Large centered arcade-style text: "RACING SIM".
- Use a retro arcade font (e.g., Press Start 2P or pixel font).
- Bottom center text: "by Manish Sai Yella" in the same arcade font, smaller.
- Bottom-right button: "NEXT ▶".
- Neon glow / retro arcade styling.
- The Three.js game MUST NOT initialize until NEXT is clicked.
- Clicking NEXT hides the landing screen and starts the game without page reload.

========================
2. CAR VISIBILITY (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================
- The car must be clearly visible at all times.
- Use a bright, high-contrast color (red, cyan, or neon magenta).
- Give the car:
  - Strong ambient light
  - Directional light from above and behind
  - Subtle emissive material so it is visible even in dark scenes
- Add a visible roof and rear so the top of the car can be seen.

========================
3. CAMERA (REAR CHASE VIEW)
========================
- Camera must follow BEHIND and ABOVE the car.
- The TOP of the car must be visible.
- The road ahead must be clearly visible.
- Camera offset example (relative to car):
  - height: +3 to +4 units
  - distance behind: -7 to -9 units
- Camera must smoothly lerp to position (cinematic follow).
- Camera should look slightly ahead of the car, not directly at center.

========================
4. TRACK & ENVIRONMENT VISIBILITY
========================
- Road surface must be clearly visible:
  - Dark asphalt but lighter than background
  - Neon edge lines or grid for contrast
- Add subtle ambient fog or horizon glow so scene is not pure black.
- Ensure ground plane and track are lit enough to see direction of travel.

========================
5. DASHBOARD (KEEP AS IS)
========================
- Keep the existing SYSTEMS dashboard exactly as it is.
- Keep:
  - Speed display
  - Gear indicator
  - Lap time
  - Best lap
  - Drive mode selector
  - HP slider
  - TCS slider
  - ESP slider
  - Any existing controls
- Controls must continue to affect car behavior in real time.

========================
6. CONTROLS (KEYBOARD ONLY)
========================
- W / Arrow Up = throttle
- S / Arrow Down = brake
- A / Arrow Left = steer left
- D / Arrow Right = steer right
- No mouse, no controller.

========================
7. PHYSICS (ARCADE-SIM FEEL)
========================
- Arcade-style physics with believable weight.
- Grip-based turning.
- Simple slip detection.
- TCS reduces throttle on high slip.
- ESP gently corrects oversteer.
- Drive modes change grip, throttle response, and ESP strength.

========================
8. PERFORMANCE & STRUCTURE
========================
- Use Three.js via CDN.
- Use a single render loop.
- Organize code cleanly with comments.
- The app must run immediately after clicking NEXT.

The most important fixes are:
1) Make the car clearly visible.
2) Fix the chase camera so the top of the car and road ahead are visible.
3) Do NOT break the dashboard UI.
