Update the visuals and driving behavior while keeping the current handling feel and UI/dashboard exactly the same.

DO NOT redesign the SYSTEMS dashboard UI. Keep the current acceleration zoom-out effect.

========================
A) VISUAL STYLE: NORMAL COLORS + PIXEL LOOK
========================
- Replace neon grid/retro synth colors with more normal racing colors:
  - Track asphalt: near-black / dark gray
  - Track edge lines: white
  - Kerbs: red/white
  - Grass: green
  - Barriers: gray with some red/white blocks
- Car color: solid red.
- Make the car and track look "pixel / low-poly / retro arcade":
  - Use nearest-neighbor pixel textures (no smoothing) for track and car details.
  - Keep geometry simple but add pixel-like texture detail to the car (windows, lights) using a small texture atlas or simple pixel pattern.
- Add simple scenery:
  - left and right barriers along the track (continuous or segmented)
  - occasional stands / grandstands (simple blocky meshes) near a few sections
  - optional trees as low-poly cones/cylinders (keep lightweight)

Implementation detail:
- Use THREE.TextureLoader with a small generated pixel texture (can be created using canvas) and set:
  texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter
  texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter
  texture.generateMipmaps = false

========================
B) TRACK: NORDSCHLEIFE-INSPIRED (NOT EXACT REPLICA)
========================
- Replace the current simple track with a long, complex closed-loop track inspired by Nürburgring Nordschleife:
  - Many corners of varying radius
  - long straights in between
  - elevation changes (uphill/downhill segments)
- IMPORTANT: Do not claim it is an exact Nürburgring replica; name it something like:
  "Green Loop" or "Nord Loop".
- Implement track using a spline/curve path and generate the road mesh along it.
- Add elevation by varying Y along the spline (smooth slopes).
- Place barriers along both sides of the road following the spline.

========================
C) DRIVING BEHAVIOR: REMOVE AUTO PATH FOLLOW
========================
Right now the car seems to follow the track path automatically. Remove that.

Required behavior:
- Car should go straight when no steering keys are pressed.
- Car should ONLY turn when A/D or Left/Right is pressed.
- If the player does not steer, the car should drive straight and crash into the barriers at turns.
- Keep the current "feel" (acceleration, grip) as much as possible.

Implementation notes:
- The car should be driven by its own forward direction and steering input (yaw).
- Do NOT project the car back onto the spline centerline.
- Collision:
  - Barriers should be colliders; if car hits barrier, stop/slide along barrier with some bounce/damping.
  - Keep it simple (AABB or distance-to-barrier segments) but must visibly prevent leaving track.

========================
D) CAMERA: KEEP ACCEL ZOOM-OUT + ADD BRAKE ZOOM-IN
========================
- Keep the existing effect: when accelerating, camera zooms out slightly.
- Add the opposite effect: when braking, camera zooms IN slightly.
- Smooth transitions (lerp), no sudden snaps.
- Use braking input strength to drive zoom-in intensity.

Example idea:
- base distance = 8
- when throttle pressed: distance -> 9.5
- when brake pressed: distance -> 6.8
- lerp each frame

========================
E) KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE WORKING
========================
- Keep keyboard controls exactly the same (WASD/arrows).
- Keep lap timer + best session timer.
- Keep dashboard controls affecting car behavior.
- Keep performance smooth and stable.
